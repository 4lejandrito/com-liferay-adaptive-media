1.) Why is generateJSPJava set in build.gradle? I don't see this anywhere else.

2.) Should this really be called blogs.web.fragment? I don't see any other .fragment in bnd.bnd like this. The closest is project-templates-fragment. If this is the correct usage, and it just happens to be first, then send a commit and remove this "2.)" and in the commit message tell me why. Thx.
